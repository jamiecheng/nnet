# A simple neural network
NNet is a simple neural network library implemented in c++. It uses matrix like arrays to train binary input data.
This is inspired by Numpy's array. A simple version of Numpy array is included to calculate like matrixes. However, 
the array included is NOT a matrix class. It only has some features like dot, transponse and exponent from a matrix.

This library is also not intended for professional usage, because it lacks performance and the code is very incomplete.
